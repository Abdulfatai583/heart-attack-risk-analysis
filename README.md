## 📌 Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project analyzes large-scale patient health data to identify key risk factors associated with heart attack occurrence and to support **data-driven preventive healthcare decisions**.

The dashboard is designed to help **healthcare professionals, analysts, and policymakers** quickly identify high-risk populations and understand how demographic, medical, and lifestyle variables contribute to heart attack risk.

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary
The dataset contains over **158,000 patient records** with a combination of demographic, medical, and lifestyle information, including:

- Age and gender  
- Income level  
- Cholesterol and blood pressure levels  
- Diabetes and hypertension status  
- Sleep duration and stress levels  
- Physical activity patterns  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
Data preparation and transformation were carried out using **Power Query**, including:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Grouping continuous variables such as age and income into analytical categories  
- Creating derived features such as cholesterol risk groups and heart attack indicators  
- Building a structured and optimized data model for Power BI analysis  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

### Overall Metrics
- **Total Patients Analyzed:** 158,000  
- **Heart Attack Rate:** ~40%  
- **Average Sleep Duration:** 6.48 hours  
- **Average Cholesterol Level:** 199.53  

### Demographic & Regional Insights
- Urban regions recorded significantly more heart attack cases than rural areas, suggesting higher lifestyle-related risk exposure.  
- Middle-aged adults showed the highest number of heart attack cases, followed by older age groups.  
- Males and individuals in lower-income categories exhibited slightly higher risk levels.  

### Health & Lifestyle Insights
- Patients with hypertension and diabetes had a significantly higher likelihood of heart attacks.  
- High stress levels and insufficient sleep were strongly correlated with increased risk.  
- Moderate physical activity and healthy sleep patterns were associated with lower risk rates.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Encourage regular physical activity and stress-management programs, particularly in urban areas.  
- Promote early health screenings for individuals with high cholesterol, diabetes, or hypertension.  
- Increase public awareness around adequate sleep (6–8 hours) and balanced nutrition.  
- Implement targeted preventive interventions for middle-aged and low-income populations.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop:** Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard development  
- **Power Query:** Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Excel:** Initial data inspection and validation  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how lifestyle behaviors and underlying medical conditions significantly influence heart attack risk.  
By leveraging **Power BI for data analysis and visualization**, the dashboard delivers actionable insights that support preventive healthcare planning and policy decisions.

The analysis highlights the importance of **data-driven decision-making** in reducing the long-term burden of cardiovascular disease.
