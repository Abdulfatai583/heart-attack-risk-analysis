## ❓ Problem Statement
Heart attacks are often preventable, but healthcare systems struggle to **identify high-risk populations early** and **understand contributing factors**.  
This project converts patient health data into **clear, actionable insights**, enabling proactive intervention and data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
*Analysis based on **158,000 patient records**.*

- **High blood pressure** is the strongest predictor of heart attack risk.  
- **Moderate to high stress levels** significantly increase risk.  
- **Middle-aged adults** show the highest incidence.  
- **Urban populations** experience more cases than rural populations.  
- Low **physical activity and poor dietary habits** correlate with higher risk.

---

## 💡 Solutions & Business Value
- Enable **early blood pressure screening** for high-risk groups.  
- Support **stress management and lifestyle intervention programs**, especially in urban areas.  
- Help healthcare planners **prioritize resources** using data-driven risk patterns.  
- Shift healthcare strategy from **reactive treatment to proactive prevention**.
