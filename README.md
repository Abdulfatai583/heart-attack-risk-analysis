## 📌 Project Overview  
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project analyzes large-scale patient health data to explain **why certain demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors are associated with higher heart attack risk**.

The dashboard supports **preventive, data-driven decision-making** by helping stakeholders identify high-risk populations early.

---

## 📊 Data Overview  
- **Total Patients:** 158,000  
- Demographics: Age group, gender, income level  
- Health factors: Cholesterol, diabetes, family history  
- Lifestyle indicators: Sleep duration & quality, alcohol consumption  
- Region: Urban vs rural  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings – Why Risk Increases  

- **Middle-aged adults** show the highest cases **because cardiovascular risk accumulates over time**.  
- **Urban populations** record more cases **due to lifestyle-related risk exposure**.  
- **Lower- and middle-income groups** are more affected, likely linked to **access and long-term stress factors**.  
- **Poor sleep quality** increases risk by impacting heart recovery and regulation.  
- **Diabetes and family history** elevate risk due to **genetic and metabolic strain on the heart**.

---

## 💡 Data-Driven Recommendations  

- Prioritize **early screening** for middle-aged individuals.  
- Target **urban communities** with lifestyle-focused health programs.  
- Promote **healthy sleep habits** as part of cardiovascular prevention.  
- Closely monitor individuals with **diabetes or family history of heart disease**.  
- Design **accessible preventive healthcare initiatives** for lower-income groups.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Excel** – Initial data inspection  


## ✅ Conclusion  
This project demonstrates that heart attack risk is driven by a **combination of demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors**, not a single cause.  
By using **Power BI for analysis and visualization**, the dashboard delivers **clear insights that support preventive healthcare decisions**.
